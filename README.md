# Felix
A Kubernetes development workflow and deployment automation tool.

## Pitch 
Felix helps developers continuously integrate each other's work by automatically updating developer and other 
environments using declarative specifications, and promotion metadata.  Felix uses a deployment agent to distribute 
containers and orchestrate deployments.
